# QERM Server and Hyak Tutorial
This repository contains all necessary materials for QERM 597, Feb 5 2020

Authors: Abby Bratt, Maria Kuruvilla, Colin Okasaki

## Prerequisites

Here is your homework for QERM 597 on Feb 5—Hyak/SEFS/QERM Servers. It requires getting access to Hyak from the Research Computing Club and the SEFS/QERM servers from SEFSIT. Both processes can take **up to a week** depending on how busy the IT folks are so we recommend you begin thinking about this as soon as possible so you are ready to go on the 5th. 

#### For the Hyak portion:
Read [the page on getting started](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/getting-started-2/getting-started/) with the Research Computing Club. The club owns a bunch of Hyak nodes purchased with the Student Technology Fee so all students can access Hyak, after jumping through a few hoops. The hoops are:

  1. Join the Research Computing Club
  
  2. Fill out the Hyak quiz
  
  3. Get added to the STF group on Hyak
  
  4. Set up two-factor authentication
  
  5. Add Hyak and Lolo as services

Details of how to do each of these are at the link above. If you are feeling adventurous you can also [read this page on the Hyak wiki](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+mox+Overview) and [this tutorial on Slurm](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Mox_scheduler), which is the resource manager Hyak uses to submit jobs. We will spend time going over this, so don't fret. 

Make sure you pay attention to any emails from the HPC list. They contain helpful Hyak updates as well as notifications about club meetings. **Everyone is required to attend at least one club meeting a year to stay on the STF partition**. 

#### For the QERM/SEFS Servers portion:
Please take a look at the [QERM wiki simulation servers page](http://wiki.cbr.washington.edu/qerm/index.php/QERM_simulation_servers). Here are the basic steps you should have completed before class on Feb 5:

  1. Contact SEFSIT to gain access to the servers. In you email, include which specific server(s) you would like access to (e.g. Snoqualmie). This should be done well in advance to give them a chance to respond.
  
  2. Mac and Linux users need to install some software. Mac users need Microsoft Remote Desktop. Linux users need to find your favorite Remote Desktop client -- Remmina seems to be the good option for Ubuntu which comes preinstalled. I'll trust Linux users to figure out whatever fiddling needs to be done ahead of time. Linux users will also need to make sure they have a SFTP program as outlined in the [UDrive instructions](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/online-storage/u-drive-central-file-storage-for-users/). Mac and Windows users have built-in programs to do this.
Note that the QERM/SEFS servers will are down approximately 1day/month for maintenance.

#### QERM/SEFS Servers

#### Hyak
We find the Hyak wiki really difficult to navigate. In our opinion the most useful pages for getting started are:

  * [Managing your files](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Managing+your+Files)
  
  * [Mox overview](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+mox+Overview)
  
  * [Scheduling jobs](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Mox_scheduler)
  
  * [Slurm tutorial](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Mox_scheduler)
  
  * [Research Computing Club](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/)
  
  * [R Programming on Hyak](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+R+programming)
  
If you don't find what you need there and you have hunted around for a bit, the Research Computing Club officers hold office hours in the eScience Institute. Find out [when](https://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/).
